# C++ Examples

This is again Apsanishant and I am making c++ examples. You can use these examples to make your own c++ program.

Example:

```
#include <iostream.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main(){
clrscr();
int a;
cout<<"enter a number";
cin>>a;
if(a%7==0 || a%8==0)
  cout<<"number is divisible by 7 or 8";
else
  cout<<"number is not divisible by 7 or 8 ";
getch();
}```
